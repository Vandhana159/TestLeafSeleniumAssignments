TestNg Assignment
Week 6 Day1 
============

 TestNg DataProvider Assignment 
. Dynamic data parametrization
     *Apply  for all the leaftaps testcases , wherever applicable
    - Create new excel document for the test cases that require the multiple data to operate on.
    - Implement the Data parametrization for all the required testcases through the DataProvider
     class to read the data from the excel sheet

Cucumber Assignment
Week 6 Day2
============
Cucumber :
*Create a separate Feature file for all the 5 testcases of leaftaps and implement it
Implement *Scenario Outline  (Wherever Applicable)
Try to apply all your learnings in your script






Steps to implement DataProvider:

1)Identify the data that are need to be dynamic for particular testcase(Cn,fn,Ln)
2)Create a method to pass data with @DataProvider annotation
// step:1 declare a 2D String array
		// first []-represent row
		// second []- represent column
		String[][] data = new String[2][4];

		// step2 :assingn data for 2D array
		// index start with 0
3)Create input array with number of rows and columns
   -Index starts with 0
4)return the data to the testcase
5)@Test(dataProvider)
6)Pass all the datas as input arguments
7)Finally,replace all the hardcoded data with the arguments

Step to Integrate ReadExcle with DataProvider
==============================================
1.Declare a String[][] variable in ReadExcle program with dimensions a rowcount and Cellcount.
2.Save data into the 2D array by having data[i-1][j]=cell.getStringCellValues
3.add return statement and chnage void to return type.
4.keyword static retain and remove String[] args  
5.Rename the method name into meaningful name
In Createlead Class
@DataProvider
excleclass.methodname();
return excleclass.methodname()





● Steps to Create File :-
After Creating features package, Mouseover on it & Right Click --> New --> Other... --> Select File under General Folder --> Click Next
      ● Set File name as Login.feature & Click Finish
      ● U can see a new file Created under features package like slice of Cucumber IMG 
Then it's Fine👍🏻🙂

Classroom:
-----------
1. Create StepDefinition class under steps package and implement methods for each steps
2. Integrate the methods with steps using cucumber annotation
3. Create a RunnerClass extends AbstractTestNGCucumberTests under runner package
4. Apply @CucumberOption with featues, glue
